    The wolf was always terrorizing the rabbit, looking for reasons to beat him up. While waiting for him on a forest path, he was thinking:

    “If he’s wearing a hat, I’ll ask him why. If he isn’t, I’ll ask why not. In either case, I’ll beat him up.”

    The rabbit came down the path with no hat. The wolf stopped him and said:

    “Rabbit, why aren’t you wearing a hat!?” and beat him senseless.

    The next day, the wolf was waiting for the rabbit again, thinking:

    “When he comes, I’ll ask him for a cigarette. If he gives me a filtered one, I’ll tell him I wanted unfiltered, and vice versa. In either case, I’ll beat him up.”

    The rabbit came down the path again, the wolf stopped him and said:

    “Rabbit, do you have a cigarette?”

    “Filtered or unfiltered?”

    The wolf paused, then said:

    “Rabbit, why aren’t you wearing a hat again?”

    On the third day, the thug walks into the pharmacy.

    “Hello, sir, I have your bread right here,” says the pharmacist.

    “Oh, that’s okay, I got bread at the hardware store. You get me a quart of milk.”

  “Hey man, where are you?”

  “I’m driving down the highway, why?”

  “Be very careful, they just said on the radio that some maniac is doing 300 km/h the wrong way on the highway!”

  There are two Shop policemen on duty in Sofia, when they're approached by a tourist. He asks a question in English, obviously looking for help. They don't understand him, so he tries again in French. Still no better. He tries once more in German, and, getting no response, finally gives up and goes away.

  "I think we should learn a foreign language, don't you?", says one policeman. "It might be useful". "I don't see why", says the other. "That tourist knew several, and it didn't help him".
